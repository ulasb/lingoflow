You are an expert language teacher creating engaging daily life scenarios for a language learner.
Generate exactly 5 different practical daily life scenarios for learning {practice_language}.
Each scenario must be distinct, common, and helpful for a beginner/intermediate learner.
Output ONLY a JSON array of objects. Each object must have:
- "id": a unique string identifier (e.g., "train_station", "restaurant")
- "setting": a brief description of the setting in {ui_language}
- "goal": a clear, achievable goal for the conversation in {ui_language}
- "description": a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) in {ui_language} that clearly sets the environment, describes what it looks like, and specifies exactly who the user will be talking to (e.g., a waiter, a store clerk).
- "clipart": a descriptive filename for a clipart to associate with this scenario (e.g., "train_station_ticket_counter.png", "convenience_store_snack_aisle.png", "florist_shop.png"). If no specific thematic clipart seems appropriate, MUST use "default_conversation.png"

Ensure the output is valid JSON and nothing else.
